#### Interfacing

<Note>

If your fabric is quite flimsy you may need to interface the brim pieces.  
The lining is only needed if you are not binding the seam allowances.  
You can also make this hat reversible by cutting an extra set of crown parts and cutting half the brim parts out of contrast fabric.
