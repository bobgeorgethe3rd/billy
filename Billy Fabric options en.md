
### Main and Contrast Fabric

Really any from of durable **Cotton**. You don't want something that super thick or thin but most **Cottons** should do the trick. You could also prehaps make it out of fleece material but this may be a tad thick (especially if also making constrast).


### Lining Fabric

Nothing fancy, a lightweight **Cotton** or anything you deem appropriate for lining should do the trick. Could easily use scraps. It could be lined with fur or fleece if you are looking for something a tad warmer.

### Interfacing

Interfacing is really only needed if you main fabric is very flimsy. However you should keep in mind that the hat is not meant to be super rigid so avoid firm and heavy weight interfacings.
