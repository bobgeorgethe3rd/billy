
To make Billy, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 metres of a suitable main fabric ([see Billy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/billy/fabric/))
- (Optional) About 0.5 metres of a suitable contrast fabric ([see Billy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/billy/fabric/))
- (Optional) About 0.5 metres of a suitable lining fabric ([see Billy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/billy/fabric/))
- (Optional) 1 metre of 1" (2.5cm) grosgrain ribbon or prefered sweatband trimming/notion
- (Optional) Binding if not using lining, can be made from main fabric.
- (Optional) Eyelets for vents and strap holes
- (Optional) Cording for straps
- (Optional) Toggles for straps
- (If needed) Interfacing ([see Billy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/billy/fabric/))

<Note>

In it's simplest form you just need the Main Fabric, binding and possibly interacing so don't feel like you need everthing on the list.
