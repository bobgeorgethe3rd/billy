
### Step 1: Prepping the pieces

- If needed, Interface the brim pieces. 
- If not already done so, it is recommended to mark the seam lines on your fabric pieces by either a temporary marker or by thread marking. This is for a more precise sew which is key for hat construction. 
- If using, mark the stitching lines on the right side of the brim pieces.

<Tip>

Thread marking allows for the seam line to be seen on both the right and wrong sides.

</Tip>

### Step 2: Constructing the Crown.

- With *good sides together* sew the crown sides along the short ends until you have a continuous ring, making sure the single and double notches stay on the same edges as each other.
- (Optional) *Staystich* the crown top. Clip to staystiching making sure not the cut through stitching.
- With *good sides together*, matching single notches, sew the crown side to the crown top.
- (Optional) Bind the seam allowances.
- Trun good sides out.

<Tip>

If you are having trouble pinning the crown side to the crown top you may find it useful to do the Staystitching step.

</Tip>

<Note>

The notches on the crown top are intended to line up with either a single notch or seam on the crown side but this might not always be possible with certain configurations of the pattern. If you find that this is the case, pick one of the seams to be an anchor and then mark quarter marks from that seam, now you can use these marks and seam to pin to the notches.

</Note>

### Step 3: Constructing the Brim.

- With *good sides together* sew the brims along the short ends creating **2** separate continuous rings, making sure the double notches stay on the same edge.
- With *good sides together* sew the 2 brim rings together alone the outer edge.
- Turn *good sides* out. Press.
- Baste the raw edges together.
- (Optional) Sew the stitching lines.

### Step 4: Construct Lining (Optional)

This step is only if you wish to line the hat rather than binding the seam allowances.

- Trim the hem allowances (bottom seam allowance) of off the lining crown side pieces
- Leave one seam open instead of completing the ring.
- Pin crossgrain ribbon (or prefered sweatband trimming/notion) along the bottom edge of the crown side with the ribbon lying falt on the *good side* of the crown side and one edge of the ribbon aligned with the raw edge of the crown side. 
- *Edgestitch* the ribbon along the edge that is **not** aligned with the raw edge of the crown side.
- Trim back the crown side underneath the ribbon.
- Sew the reaming crown side seam.
- Press the seam allowance open and *Edgestitch* the seam allowance down along the ribbon.
- With *good sides together*, matching single notches, sew the lining crown side to the lining crown top.

### Step 5: Assembly.

- With *good sides together* sew the brim to the crown side, matching double notches and seams.
- Press seam allowances to the inside.
- If not lining bind the raw edge.
- If lining pin the lining crown into the crown, wrong sides together, matching seams.
- *Slipstich* or *Whipstitch* the lining in place.

### Step 6: Snaps, Vents and Straps.

All these are optional add-ons so you can skip these steps if you don't need/want them.

- If using attach snaps to crown side and brims where marked on the pattern, making sure the stud is on the crown and the socket is on the brim.
- If needed, Construct eyelets at vent marks.
- If needed, Construct eyelets at strap marks being careful not to daamge the bottom seam allowances.
- Thread cord through the strap holes to make your straps.

<Note>
Vents and stap holes are marked by buttons on the patterns.  
All markings on the pattern are a suggested placement/number of snaps, vents and strap holes, they are not set in stone so you do you :)

</Note>

### Step 7: Outer Band (Optional)

- Construct an outer band by using the measurements provided on the pattern.
- Sew the band to the *good sides* of the crown either by hand or machine.

<Note>

If making straps the band should encase the cord on the outside of the crown.

</Note>

### Step 8: Enjoy!

- You're all done! Now go enjoy your hat and catch some fish, race an elytra course or whatever you do in a bucket hat.

<Note>

#### Make it Reversible!

Made one already or just fancy something different? Make a reversible one!

- Construct 2 crowns, 1 of your main fabric, 1 of your constrast fabric.
- Construct 2 brim rings, 1 of your main fabric, 1 of your constrast fabric but refrain from stitching them together.
- Stitch the brim rings to their respected crown sides, *good sides together*.
- With *good sides together* sew your two respective hats together along the outer brim edge leaving a gap for turning.
- Trun *good sides* out. Press
- *Slipstich* the opening close.
- Stitch the stitching lines.
- You're all done! Now enjoy your dual sided hat!

<Tip>

If you wish the stitching lines to be different colours on each side use different bobbin and top threads.
